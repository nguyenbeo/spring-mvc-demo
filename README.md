# spring-mvc-demo
A short demo on how Spring MVC 4 works:
* How to build up a simple webpage
* How Spring form and validation works
* Custom annotations
* Exception handler by using ControllerAdvice

Technologies:
* Spring 4
* Spring MVC
* Spring Web

In this demo, I tried to get rid of web.xml configuration by using WebAppInitializer class instead. This is applied for servlet 3.1 or greater.

# How to run
mvn jetty:run-war
